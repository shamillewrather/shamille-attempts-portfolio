Hello!

I'm Shamille. It's been awhile since I've created any web app or website from scratch. This is my first official personal project and I plan on using Git to get there.

If you see this file on my project, it's because I'm trying to get back into front end dev with tiny baby steps.

It's daunting, but I hope it'll lead to something!

Thank you so much for reading! â˜º
